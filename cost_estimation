2. Snowflake Warehouse Cost
The cost of Snowflake depends on the compute size and usage hours (billed per second). For example:

Small Warehouse (XS): ~$2/hour
Medium Warehouse (M): ~$4/hour
Large Warehouse (L): ~$8/hour
Monthly and Yearly Snowflake Compute Cost (Based on 8 Hours/Day Usage):
Warehouse Size	Hourly Rate	Monthly Cost (240 Hours)	Yearly Cost (2,920 Hours)
XS	$2.00	$480	$5,840
M	$4.00	$960	$11,680
L	$8.00	$1,920	$23,360
3. AWS EC2 Source Instance Cost
AWS EC2 costs vary based on the instance type and region.

Estimated EC2 Instance Costs:
Instance: t3.medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM) → $0.0416/hour
Instance: t3.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM) → $0.0832/hour
Monthly and Yearly EC2 Costs (24/7 Operation):
Instance Size	Hourly Rate	Monthly Cost (730 Hours)	Yearly Cost (8,760 Hours)
t3.medium	$0.0416	$30	$365
t3.large	$0.0832	$60	$730
4. Additional Costs
AWS S3 Data Storage: ~$0.023/GB/month.
Data Transfer:
Snowflake ingress (upload): Free.
Snowflake egress (download): ~$90 per TB.
Total Cost Estimation
Assuming:

Matillion runs on m5.large.
Snowflake uses an XS warehouse for 8 hours/day.
AWS EC2 uses a t3.medium instance.
Component	Monthly Cost	Yearly Cost
Matillion License	$1,000	$12,000
Snowflake (XS)	$480	$5,840
AWS EC2 (t3.medium)	$30	$365
Total	$1,510	$18,205
Adjustments Based on Your Needs:
If Matillion operates for limited hours/day, reduce the instance cost proportionally.
Scale Snowflake warehouse size and runtime based on workload.
